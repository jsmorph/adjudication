# AAR Process and HTTP Specification

## Scope

This specification defines the external behavior of one `aar case` process.  It covers process startup, standard streams, the private Lawyer and Council APIs, records, results, and participant failures.  Multi-case management and participant transport belong to the `service` branch.

## Process Model

`aar case` runs one arbitration from a complaint to a terminal state.  Its flags select the complaint, identifiers, output directory, private API address, policy, evidence files, council pool, prompts, limits, engine, and council backend.  The process owns the case state and every participant opportunity until completion.

When the private API starts, the command writes a diagnostic line to standard error with the prefix `caseapi listening on `.  The suffix contains the base URL without a role path.  A caller that supplies the listen address can instead poll `/health` for readiness.

The command writes one JSON summary line to standard output when the case ends.  A normal result uses `status: "ok"` and reports the resolution, while a recorded lawyer failure uses `status: "failed"` and can still exit zero.  Startup, configuration, engine, storage, and other process failures return a nonzero exit status.

## Common HTTP Rules

The private API listens only for the running case.  Requests identify the configured `case_id`, and mutating participant requests include the current opportunity id.  The case process validates identity, role authority, deadline, attempt budget, evidence rules, and phase before accepting an operation.

JSON responses include `ok` unless an endpoint serves bytes.  Request failures use an HTTP error status and a structured error object.  A procedurally invalid tool call can return HTTP 200 with `ok: false` because the case process received and rejected the operation.

## Lawyer API

The Lawyer API lives under `/lawyerapi/v1`.  Lawyer roles are `plaintiff` and `defendant`, and `observer` provides read-only access.  Every request includes the case id and applicable role id.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/lawyerapi/v1/get` | Return current role status, prompt, tools, limits, and turn. |
| `GET` | `/lawyerapi/v1/wait` | Wait for a role state change or timeout. |
| `GET` | `/lawyerapi/v1/status` | Return compact case and turn status. |
| `GET` | `/lawyerapi/v1/result` | Return the terminal result or pending status. |
| `POST` | `/lawyerapi/v1/do` | Execute one support, evidence, work-note, or legal operation. |

A ready turn includes its opportunity id, phase, prompt, available tools, limits, time remaining, and attempts remaining.  A mutating request supplies that opportunity id with the tool name and arguments.  Waiting, completed, and failed cases report `waiting`, `done`, and `failed` status values.

Lawyer operations include case reads, private work notes, evidence listing, evidence metadata, bounded evidence reads, direct evidence submission, chunked upload, and legal-decision submission.  Evidence reads remain available across lawyer phases.  Evidence submission remains limited to the phases defined by the procedure.

## Council API

The Council API is active when `--council-backend councilapi` selects external council members.  Requests under `/councilapi/v1` identify the case and bound member.  Each seated member receives an opportunity during deliberation and can read admitted evidence before voting.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/councilapi/v1/get` | Return member status, prompt, tools, limits, and turn. |
| `GET` | `/councilapi/v1/wait` | Wait for a member state change or timeout. |
| `POST` | `/councilapi/v1/do` | Read evidence or submit a vote. |
| `POST` | `/councilapi/v1/fail` | Record failure for the active member opportunity. |

Council operations include case reads, evidence listing, evidence metadata, bounded evidence reads, and `submit_council_vote`.  A vote states `demonstrated` or `not_demonstrated`, confidence, and rationale.  The runtime supplies the trusted member identity rather than accepting authority from the vote payload.

## Results and Failures

`run.json` records the final state, resolution, council roster, votes, admitted evidence, final reason, and generated artifacts.  `state.json`, `certificate.json`, `events.ndjson`, `evidence-manifest.json`, `transcript.md`, and `digest.md` supply the other durable views.  The command summary identifies the run, output directory, status, and resolution.

A lawyer failure ends the arbitration and records a structured failure.  The failure identifies the role, phase, opportunity, reason, and message.  A council-member failure dismisses that member and permits the remaining seated council to continue when the policy allows it.

## Test Obligations

Process tests start the real command and communicate through the private HTTP APIs.  They verify startup, opportunity identity, deadlines, attempt exhaustion, evidence custody, participant failure, terminal summaries, and durable records.  Replay tests verify that `certificate.json` reproduces the recorded terminal state through the selected Lean engine.
