This file proves Stage 7 of the verification plan: deliberation neutrality.

The aggregation rule in `currentResolution?` checks `demonstrated` before
`not_demonstrated`.  That ordering is neutral only when both substantive
outcomes cannot reach the configured threshold at the same time.  The policy
validator now enforces exactly that condition through the strict-majority
requirement.

The proof still needs one additional invariant from reachable states.  The
current round cannot contain more distinct votes than there are seated council
members, and seated membership cannot exceed `policy.council_size`.  Those are
the facts that let the strict-majority arithmetic rule out the dual-threshold
case.

/--
Flipping every current-round vote in a reachable state swaps the result of
`currentResolution?` in the same way.

This is the public neutrality theorem for the aggregation rule over the full
validated policy space.  It depends on two facts that the earlier proof layers
already established: reachable states preserve a strict-majority threshold, and
reachable deliberation records never contain more distinct current-round votes
than there are council seats available to cast them.
