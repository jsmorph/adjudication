This file begins the outcome-soundness proof layer.

The earlier global invariants show that reachable states keep the procedure in
order, preserve side-to-side parity, respect cumulative material limits, and
keep the initialized case frame fixed.  Those theorems still leave the most
important public question open.

When the engine closes a case with `demonstrated`, `not_demonstrated`, or
`no_majority`, does that result follow from the recorded deliberation state?

The executable closing logic is concentrated in `continueDeliberation`.  That
is the right place to start.  This file proves that the three closing branches
of `continueDeliberation` are sound with respect to the recorded votes, the
configured threshold, and the round and seating conditions.

This is not yet the final reachable-state theorem recorded in
`docs/verification.md`.  It is the first layer that the global theorem will
need.  The result says that whenever deliberation closes a case, the closure is
justified by the deliberation record that the engine carries in state.

This theorem packages the three executable closing branches behind one summary

closure when the round is complete and the executable closure reason holds.

If deliberation closes a case as `no_majority`, neither side reached the vote
threshold, and closure happened for one of the two executable reasons:

1. too few seated members remained to make the threshold possible; or
2. the round was complete, the final round had been reached, and no side had
   yet reached the threshold.

Every reachable closed `demonstrated` result is sound.

The base case is impossible because initialization always opens the case.  The
step case reduces immediately to the public step theorem above.

A successful council-vote step that closes as `demonstrated` has a sound
outcome.

This theorem lifts the previous result from the raw deliberation helper to the
public `step` boundary for council votes.

/--
A successful council-removal step that closes the case has a sound outcome.

The removal step can close as `no_majority` immediately when the threshold
becomes impossible.  The theorem is stated in the same shape as the vote-step
wrappers so later global theorems can work uniformly over the public step
boundary.
