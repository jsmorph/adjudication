# Agent District Court Manual

## Operating Model

Agent District Court (ADC) runs a civil case through a Lean rule engine and a Go runtime.  A complaint becomes a normalized one-claim case and then proceeds through pleadings, motions, discovery, trial, verdict, and judgment.  An existing scenario JSON can begin at the same runtime boundary without complaint preparation.

The case process owns the Lean state, current opportunity, case-file visibility, decision validation, deadlines, invalid-attempt limits, event log, and final record.  It handles a role through a direct model call unless the command names that role with `--external-role`.  An external plaintiff, defendant, or juror receives opportunities through the case-owned HTTP Role API.

`adc case` prepares and runs a complaint.  `adc scenario` runs an existing scenario, including a deterministic offline scenario.  The remaining commands prepare inputs, validate scenarios, inspect records, and replay completed cases.

All examples assume the working directory is `adc/`.  `make build` writes `.bin/adc` and `.bin/adcengine`.  The service branch contains Clerk processes, agent launchers, MCP adapters, attestation, and deployment material.

## Commands

The root command reports the current subcommands through `adc help`.  Each subcommand reports its flags through `adc help COMMAND`.  The table summarizes the command boundaries.

| Goal | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Draft a complaint from a situation file. | `adc complain --situation FILE` |
| Prepare and adjudicate a complaint. | `adc case --complaint FILE` |
| Build a deterministic complaint archive and manifest. | `adc case-packet --complaint FILE --packet FILE --manifest FILE` |
| Adjudicate an existing scenario. | `adc scenario --scenario FILE` |
| Validate an existing scenario. | `adc validate --scenario FILE` |
| Read PACER-style documents from a run database. | `adc pacer --db FILE` |
| Replay a completed transition record. | `adc verify-certificate --dir DIR` |

## Build and Environment

ADC requires Go 1.25, Lean 4.32.0, `lake`, and `make`.  The Go runtime starts `.bin/adcengine` by default, so a normal adjudication requires both binaries.  The following commands build the binaries, run the Go tests, and build the Lean proof tree.

```bash
make build
make test
make prove
```

Complaint drafting, complaint preparation, reports, and direct role turns use the shared OpenAI-compatible client.  These paths require the credentials and base URL accepted by that client.  A deterministic `adc scenario --offline` run makes no model calls.

## Complaint Preparation

`adc complain` reads a situation markdown file, resolves the selected court profile, includes linked local files as source context, and writes a complaint.  The default output is `complaint.md` beside the situation file.  The command uses the selected planner model.

```bash
.bin/adc complain \
  --situation examples/ex1/situation.md \
  --out examples/ex1/complaint.md
```

`adc case-packet` packages a complaint and its linked local files in a deterministic `tar.gz` archive.  Its JSON manifest records the archived paths and file hashes.  Packet construction fails when a linked file is absent or lies outside the complaint directory.

```bash
.bin/adc case-packet \
  --complaint examples/ex1/complaint.md \
  --packet out/ex1/case.tar.gz \
  --manifest out/ex1/case-packet.json
```

`adc case` performs a model-driven setup stage before adjudication.  The stage writes `normalized-case.json`, `plaintiff-strategy.md`, `defense-strategy.md`, and `generated-scenario.json` under the output directory.  The runner then adjudicates the generated scenario.

## Scenario Files

A scenario JSON defines the court, initial case metadata, claims, roles, optional deterministic turns, optional loop policy, and assertions.  `adc validate` reports unknown roles, missing action types, unsupported actions, and whether the scenario requires model turns.  It returns an error when the scenario is invalid.

`adc scenario` can override the default model, temperatures, jury policy, runtime limits, and identifiers.  It can expose selected roles through the Role API and can write a transcript or digest in addition to the required machine records.  `--allow-assertion-failures` preserves a successful process exit after recording failed scenario assertions.

```bash
.bin/adc validate --scenario PATH/TO/scenario.json

.bin/adc scenario \
  --scenario PATH/TO/scenario.json \
  --output out/scenario/run.json \
  --runtime out/scenario/runtime.json \
  --events out/scenario/events.ndjson \
  --db out/scenario/run.db \
  --transcript out/scenario/transcript.md \
  --digest out/scenario/digest.md
```

An offline run permits deterministic turns and rejects the need for a model during execution.  The validator reports `requires_llm` before such a run.  The runner also warns when `--offline` accompanies a scenario that contains non-deterministic turns.

## Jury Configuration

Jury policy consists of jury size, unanimity, and minimum concurrence.  `adc case` and `adc scenario` expose these settings as `--juror-count`, `--unanimous-required`, and `--minimum-concurring`.  Omitted flags preserve the scenario or court defaults.

The engine accepts 6 through 12 jurors.  The minimum concurrence must lie between 6 and the configured jury size.  A deliberating-juror failure removes that juror from the effective concurrence calculation while preserving the nominal policy in the case record.

Juror request specifications come from the JSONL file named by `--juror-personas`.  Each record can select the endpoint, model, provider constraints, request settings, and persona for a juror.  The direct runtime applies those request specifications through the shared model client.

## `adc case`

`adc case` prepares one complaint and adjudicates the resulting scenario.  It opens the SQLite record, starts the Lean-backed opportunity loop, and writes a JSON summary to standard output.  The output directory contains the prepared inputs and adjudication record.

| Flag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--complaint` | Complaint markdown path.  Required. |
| `--court` | Court profile name or JSON path. |
| `--out-dir` | Directory for prepared inputs and records. |
| `--model` | Default runtime model for generated scenario roles. |
| `--non-juror-model` | Default model for judge, clerk, plaintiff, and defendant. |
| `--plaintiff-model`, `--defendant-model` | Party-specific model overrides. |
| `--judge-model`, `--clerk-model` | Court-role model overrides. |
| `--planner-model` | Model for intake and strategy preparation. |
| `--report-model` | Model for digest generation. |
| `--temperature` | Default runtime temperature override. |
| `--non-juror-temperature`, `--juror-temperature` | Role-class temperature overrides. |
| `--juror-personas` | JSONL juror request-specification file. |
| `--trial-mode` | `auto`, `jury`, or `bench`. |
| `--skip-voir-dire` | Empanel randomly after trial setup. |
| `--juror-count` | Jury size from 6 through 12. |
| `--unanimous-required` | `true` or `false`. |
| `--minimum-concurring` | Required concurring jurors. |
| `--online` | Enable web search for direct model calls. |
| `--timeout-seconds` | Model HTTP timeout. |
| `--invalid-attempt-limit` | Invalid responses allowed during one turn. |
| `--max-response-bytes` | Maximum direct-model response size. |
| `--external-role` | Role served through the Role API.  Repeat as needed. |
| `--caseapi-addr` | Role API listen address. |
| `--roleapi-timeout-seconds` | Deadline for each external opportunity. |
| `--case-id`, `--run-id` | API and record identifiers. |
| `--engine` | Lean engine command. |

This example uses direct model calls for every procedural role.  It requests a jury trial and writes the complete case under `out/ex1`.  The generated run identifier also becomes the case identifier unless `--case-id` changes it.

```bash
.bin/adc case \
  --complaint examples/ex1/complaint.md \
  --out-dir out/ex1 \
  --trial-mode jury
```

## Role API

The Role API listens when `--caseapi-addr` supplies an address.  Every role request includes `case_id`; lawyer requests identify `plaintiff` or `defendant`, and juror requests also include a `principal_id` such as `J1`.  The read-only observer uses `role_id=observer`.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/health` | Report that the case API is listening. |
| `GET` or `POST` | `/roleapi/v1/status` | Return case status, current turn, and any caller-owned opportunity. |
| `GET` or `POST` | `/roleapi/v1/get` | Return the caller's current opportunity without waiting. |
| `GET` or `POST` | `/roleapi/v1/wait_for_opportunity` | Wait up to 30 seconds for an opportunity or terminal status. |
| `GET` or `POST` | `/roleapi/v1/result` | Return the final result, failure, or pending status. |
| `POST` | `/roleapi/v1/do` | Execute a support operation, work-note submission, or legal decision. |
| `POST` | `/roleapi/v1/fail` | Report failure for the active external opportunity. |

An opportunity response identifies its id, phase, kind, time remaining, attempts remaining, and support-operation budget.  It also supplies the role prompt, role-visible case view, permitted legal tools, legal-tool schemas, and support-operation schemas.  A submission must use the opportunity id from that response.

```bash
curl -sS \
  'http://127.0.0.1:9001/roleapi/v1/wait_for_opportunity?case_id=adc-CASE&role_id=plaintiff&timeout_ms=30000'
```

`POST /roleapi/v1/do` accepts the case identity, role identity, opportunity identity, operation name, and operation arguments.  `case_status` needs no opportunity id, while `send_work_notes` and `submit_decision` apply to the active opportunity.  Support operations include `get_case`, `explain_decisions`, `list_case_files`, `read_case_text_file`, `request_case_file`, `read_case_file_bytes`, and `get_juror_context` when the current role permits them.

```json
{
  "case_id": "adc-CASE",
  "role_id": "plaintiff",
  "principal_id": "",
  "opportunity_id": "OPPORTUNITY",
  "tool": "submit_decision",
  "arguments": {
    "kind": "tool",
    "tool_name": "record_opening_statement",
    "payload": {
      "party": "plaintiff",
      "summary": "Plaintiff will prove the claim through the admitted record."
    }
  }
}
```

A legal-tool decision uses `kind=tool`, `tool_name`, and `payload`.  A pass uses `kind=pass` and `reason` when the opportunity permits passing.  Lean checks the opportunity id, state version, role, tool permission, and payload before accepting the transition.

External lawyer failure ends the case because the party can no longer complete its active opportunity.  External juror failure follows the engine's juror timeout and dismissal rules.  Candidate replacement can occur during voir dire, while failure during deliberation removes the juror from the effective concurrence count.

Start a case with two external lawyers by naming both roles.  The same case process continues to handle judge, clerk, and juror opportunities through direct model calls.  External clients can then use the Role API without access to the output directory.

```bash
.bin/adc case \
  --complaint examples/ex1/complaint.md \
  --out-dir out/ex1-roleapi \
  --caseapi-addr 127.0.0.1:9001 \
  --external-role plaintiff \
  --external-role defendant
```

## Legal Tools

Lean determines the legal tools permitted for each opportunity.  The Role API returns those names and their schemas with the current opportunity.  The scenario role definition provides the broad role capability, while the current Lean state selects the permitted subset.

Party tools cover pleadings, discovery, dispositive motions, evidence, trial presentation, objections, closing arguments, and post-verdict work.  Judge tools control motions, trial mode, voir dire rulings, jury instructions, judgment, and bench opinions.  Clerk tools record administrative acts, configure the jury, and advance procedural stages.

Jurors answer questionnaires, answer voir dire questions, and vote during deliberation.  A vote identifies the juror, prevailing party, damages, confidence, and explanation.  The engine derives a verdict from eligible jurors under the recorded jury policy.

## Record Utilities

`adc pacer` reads the SQLite record written by a run.  It returns the latest case unless `--case-id` names another case, and `--document-id` selects one PACER-style document.  JSON is the default output format.

`adc verify-certificate` reads a completed output directory or explicit certificate and state paths.  It replays the recorded initialization and accepted engine transitions through the selected Lean engine.  It then compares the replayed state, certificate hash, and recorded `state.json`.

```bash
.bin/adc pacer --db out/ex1/run.db
.bin/adc verify-certificate --dir out/ex1
```

## Output Record

Complaint preparation and adjudication share one output directory.  The prepared files explain how ADC transformed the complaint into a scenario.  The runtime files preserve the accepted actions, final state, reports, and role work notes.

| File | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `complaint.md` | Staged complaint text. |
| `input-files/` | Staged complaint attachments. |
| `normalized-case.json` | Planner-produced one-claim case. |
| `plaintiff-strategy.md` | Private plaintiff strategy. |
| `defense-strategy.md` | Private defense strategy. |
| `generated-scenario.json` | Scenario produced by complaint preparation. |
| `runtime.json` | Normalized timeout, response-size, and invalid-attempt limits. |
| `events.ndjson` | Runtime event log. |
| `run.db` | SQLite case record. |
| `run.json` | Machine-readable result. |
| `state.json` | Terminal Lean state. |
| `certificate.json` | Initialization, accepted transitions, claimed state, and hashes. |
| `transcript.md` | Written transcript. |
| `digest.md` | Written case digest. |
| `work-notes.ndjson` | Private work notes submitted by roles. |

The replay certificate records engine-visible accepted transitions.  It omits rejected attempts, record reads, work notes, and model calls.  A successful replay establishes that the recorded transition sequence produces the claimed final state under the selected engine.

The replay certificate carries no signature or execution attestation.  Any procedurally valid transition sequence can produce a valid replay result.  Authentication of the execution record requires evidence maintained outside this core replay check.

## Failure Diagnosis

Complaint preparation and packet creation require readable source files.  Linked local files must remain below the complaint directory, and missing or escaping paths cause preparation to fail.  The presence of `normalized-case.json`, strategy files, and `generated-scenario.json` identifies the last completed preparation stage.

A Role API client that receives `waiting` can inspect `current_turn` through the observer status response.  Another role, another juror principal, or an internal court role may own the current opportunity.  The following request reports that state without claiming an opportunity.

```bash
curl -sS \
  'http://127.0.0.1:9001/roleapi/v1/status?case_id=adc-CASE&role_id=observer'
```

Certificate verification errors distinguish missing files, replay failures, final-state differences, and hash differences.  The certificate and `state.json` must come from the same completed run.  The verifier must use the compatible `.bin/adcengine` command selected by `--engine`.
